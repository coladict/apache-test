 - print STDERR is buffered in test handlers, whereas warn() works
   normally. select() helps, but STDERR should be unbuffered in first
   place.

 - Apache::TestServer::start_debugger will choose between start_gdb,
   start_dbx, ddd etc., counting on people who want to use other
   debuggers to submit patches.

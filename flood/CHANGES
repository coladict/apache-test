Changes since milestone-0-1:

* Added delay support for urllist. A urllist entry can now be
  given a delay (in seconds) that happens each time that URL
  is used in a request. [Justin Erenkrantz]

* Changed "simple" and "easy" reporting systems to both print
  out the URL for each request. [Aaron Bannert]

* Now using strncasecmp() instead of strncmp() to compare XML
  identifiers. [Aaron Bannert]

* There is now limited support for Cookies in a Round Robin profile.
  [Justin Erenkrantz]

* A Farm can consist of multiple Farmers now, instead of being
  restricted to a single Farmer named "Joe". (This is only correct
  if you have thread support on your system.) [Aaron Bannert]

* Limited support for Farms has been implemented. There can
  be one Farm named "Bingo". [Aaron Bannert]

Release:

    ASF-transfer:   Released July 17, 2001
    milestone-0-1:  Tagged July 11, 2001 (tag lost during transfer)

RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * "Everything needs to work perfectly"

Other bugs that need fixing:

    * DNS lookup failures in any <urllist> cause segfault.
       Justin says: Wow.  Why?

    * We're cheating a bit at the network level.  read_socket only
      reads what is available at that point in time.  It probably
      needs to read until we hit EOF (we're specifing Connection: Close).
      But, what do we do with the intermediate data?  Store only the first 
      X KB (8KB?) bytes of the response?  This starts to lead into bucket 
      brigades.  Consider as you read from the socket bucket, it morphs and
      does a read into to a char*/heap bucket (what's available now) and 
      the original socket bucket is preserved if we are not at EOS 
      (remember EOS for keepalive isn't signaled with EOF).  
       Status: We need to figure out what to do for now.  I think we can 
               just hack at read_socket or recv_resp to read from the 
               socket until it hits EOF.  Roy needs to guide us in the 
               right direction here...

Bugs and features that have been fixed:
    Aaron says: "We delete these fixes from STATUS when they are 'verified'."

    * When parsing XML identifiers, we should be using strncasecmp()
      instead of strncmp().
       Status: Aaron says "fixed, please verify".

    * Cookies
       Status: Aaron says "Justin did this for Round Robin, hurray!"

    * Can only use one farmer named "Joe".
       Status: Aaron says "fixed when threads are enabled, please verify".

    * Farm (Single-process, multiple farmers)
       Status: Justin says "Aaron did this."

Other features that need writing:

    * Validation of responses (known C-L, specific strings in response)
       Status: Justin volunteers

    * HTTP Keepalive
       Justin says: We'll try and get this to work by 7/13, but this is
                    pushing it.  There's a lot of stuff to getting
                    keepalive right (edge cases).  May try to push this
                    off until we've had some real-world experience with 
                    the flood code.  I'm still not sure how this will
                    work.

    * HTTP/SSL Keepalive
       Justin says: This is more important than HTTP Keepalive.

    * HTTP error codes (ie. teach it about 302s)
       Justin says: Yeah, this won't be with round_robin as implemented.  
                    Need a linked list-based profile where we can insert 
                    new URLs into the sequence.

    * Farmer (Single-thread, multiple profiles)
       Status: Aaron says: If you have threads, then any Farmer can be
       run as part of any Farm. If you don't have threads, you can
       currently only run one Farmer named "Joe" right now (this will
       be changed so that if you don't have threads, flood will attempt
       to run all Farmers in serial under one process).

    * Timed Farmer
      A type of farmer that runs for a specified amount of time,
      instead of a number of iterations. Assumedly it will have to
      report the number of iterations it ran within that timeframe.
       Status: Aaron volunteers.

    * Collective (Single-host, multiple farms)
      This is a number of Farms that have been fork()ed into child processes.

    * Megaconglomerate (Multiple hosts each running a collective)
      This is a number of Collectives running on a number of hosts, invoked
      via RSH/SSH or maybe even some proprietary mechanism.

    * Timers
      Metrics include:
        a) TCP connect() time
        b) Time to send request (time to fill local outbound buffers)
        c) Time until first response chunk was received
           (tests network latency at the application layer (HTTP))
        d) Time to receive a full response
        e) (optional) Local processing time, such as time to generate
           a request.
      Status: Aaron is interested, but won't volunteer until he's done
        with the other things on his plate.

    * Other types of urllists
        a) Random / Random-weighted
        b) Sequenced (useful with cookie propogation)
        c) Round-robin
        d) Chaining of the above strategies
      Status: Round-robin is complete.

    * Other types of reports
      Status: Aaron says: "simple" reports are functional. Justin added
              a new type that simply prints the approx. timestamp when
              the test was run, and the result as OK/FAIL; it is called
              "easy reports" (see flood_easy_reports.h).
              Furthermore, simple_reports and easy_reports both print
              out the current requesting URI line.

Documentation that needs writing:

    * Documentation?  What documentation? RTFS?

    * Feature set
      We'll have to eventually write down all the features we support,
      which will most likely come out to be the various XML parameters
      we support.

Available Patches:

Open issues:

    * Validating XML Parser?
       Justin says: I don't think we want this.  We want a standalone 
                    validator.
       Aaron says: I strongly feel we should have this turned on at
                   least for the invoking "Megaconglomerate". The added
                   overhead for validating when we're already parsing
                   will be minimal. It will not affect the results of
                   the tests. It only happens when a new flood process
                   is created (directly or via rsh/ssh), not when invoking
                   a collective, farm, farmer, or profile. What it gives
                   us from the user's standpoint is far greater than
                   the impact of the added startup overhead.
                   (Maybe a flood argument that disables it for when
                   some UI wrapper already did the checking or if it's
                   being invoked as part of a megaconglomerate (rsh/ssh).)
  
    * Supporting use of installed APR / APR-util
       Justin says: Requires changes to APR/APR-util to make it install
                    the right stuff.  We currently rely on the source.

    * Mandrake Linux 8.0 and OpenSSL 0.9.6a just aren't coexisting at all.
      The problem seems to be that OpenSSL is refusing to initialize the
      PRNG.  Go figure.  I give up on this for now, but it is a big nasty
      bug in something somewhere.  This code works on Solaris/Intel.
      That's all I'll say on the matter for now.

    * Report Aggregation
      We're not sure how to handle reporting quite yet. We'd like to keep
      it open ended and flexible, but that will be difficult to do while
      maintaining the ability to run a huge variety of tests.

    * WebLogic 5.10 Service Pack 9
      No one told BEA how to make an HTTP server.  Send it Connection: Close
      and a cookie, and it'll respond with Connection: Keep-Alive (no cookie
      and it honors Connection: Close).  That's wrong.
